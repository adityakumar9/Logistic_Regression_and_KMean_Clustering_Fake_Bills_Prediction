# Logistic_Regression_and_KMean_Clustering_Fake_Bills_Prediction
Fake bill predictions, where I used logistic regression and KMean clustering model to find accuracy and for better understanding I created visualization for clustering and found correlations between all variables also find the ROC and Area Under the Curve..
About Dataset
The dataset includes 1500 rows and 7 columns:
•	is_genuine: boolean
•	diagonal: float
•	height_left: float
•	height_right: float
•	margin_low: float
•	margin_upper: float
•	length: float
Idea of projects with this dataset:
•	Comparing classification such as logistic regression or KNN with an unsupervised model such as K-Means to predict the authenticity of the bills
